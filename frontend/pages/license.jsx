        <p>
          1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
          Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the

        <p>
          {" "}
          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where

          {" "}
          3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

          not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making
          technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
          including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
          making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) (4) never

        <p>
          {" "}
          a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of
          the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
          Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
          conditions of this Public License.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
          additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
          Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts
          exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
          Material.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
          be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
          Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
          endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
          designated to receive attribution as provided in Section

        <p>b. Other rights.</p>
        <p>
          1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
          under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other
          similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by
          the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise
          the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public
          License.

        <p>
          3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect

          directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
          waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
          the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
